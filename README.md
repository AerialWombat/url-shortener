# breve

A mobile-friendly, front-end website built using ReactJS to interact with a [Node.js/Express API](https://github.com/AerialWombat/url-shortener-api) I built to shorten URLs.

## How To Use

- The application allows you to register and log in to a user account to save shortened URLs to your username. A demo account is provided on the login screen.
- On the main view, simply enter a URL with valid formatting into the "Long URL" field and submit it. A shortened URL will appear underneath with a button to copy to your clipboard. Currently the URLs are still pretty big due to the free Netlify domain being used.

### Built With

- ES6 Javascript
- Flexbox
- CSS Modules & SCSS
- ReactJS
- React Router
